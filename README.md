# Get LOVE
Download the latest version of LÖVE from the website https://love2d.org/#download and install it. If you're on Windows and don't want to install LÖVE, you can also just download the zipped executables and extract them anywhere.

# Running the game:
It's much easier to setup LOVE on Windows

### Windows:
The easiest way to run the game is to drag the folder onto either love.exe or a shortcut to love.exe. Remember to drag the folder containing main.lua, and not main.lua itself.

### Linux
On Linux, you can use one of these command lines:
love /home/path/to/gamedir/

love /home/path/to/packagedgame.love
